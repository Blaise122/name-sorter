This Name Sorting Algorithm takes as an argument the path to a file containing a list of unsorted names,

which it reads and sorts alphabetically first by last name, then by first names, before writing the sorted

file to `./sorted-names-list.txt` and to the console.

The program is capable of sorting a name that has at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

Challenges encountered incuded seting up Visual Studio for Mac and familarising myself to it and geting a

basic understaning for C# for the first time.

The sorting function used is the default C# `string.Sort()` method.

Use: `unsorted-names-list.txt <path-to-input-file>`
